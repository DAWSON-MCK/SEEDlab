Demo 1, The goal was to detect and recognize a strip of 1" blue tape, and report the angle in degrees between the camera axis (i.e. an arrow
pointing out of the camera perpendicular to the camera face) and the tape. The angle is signed, with a positive angle when the tape is to the left of the camera axis.
The robot is also supposed to move forward in a straight line and stop after a specified distance in feet (between 1 and 10 feet).
rotate the robot by a specified angle in degrees, and move forward a specified distance in feet.
